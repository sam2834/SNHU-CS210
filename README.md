# SNHU-CS210
This was a project designed to convert Fahrenheit temperature averages associated with a city name to Celsius and post the results to a txt file.
I clearly commented my code and ensured its readability.
If I wanted to enhance the code, I would rewrite so there's not a limit of 6 cities to convert temps for. This improvement would give the code more utility.
The most challenging portion of this code was getting lines mixed up in file input. I solved this by methodically rechecking the program output using test lines of console output to check what exactly the code was doing to the input. These I later deleted. GitHub itself is a wonderful resource, as well as stackoverflow.com and the c++ library.
The skill of amending file data is important in programming and can be used in far too many other places to mention.
The key to keeping the program maintainable and readable was a having a clear vision of what the program needed to do, using a standard naming convention, and adding concise comments.
